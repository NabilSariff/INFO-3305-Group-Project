<h1>About Shoeniverse</h1>
<p>Since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the rest of the world, many have been affected by this condition and are going through new norms to survive. Shoeniverse is an app that has options for those who love shoes as their lifestyle. Basically, people will buy it in physical stores but as a result of this pandemic, movement becomes limited. So, with this app they can choose their favorite shoes through online.</p>

<p>Moving in line with todayâ€™s world of technology, we got the idea to develop this Shoeniverse app. With this application, they do not have to worry about going out to find shoes in the physical store because through this application, it can curb close contact and break the Covid-19 chain. Not only that, the shoes offered are also unisex type shoes. In this case, men and women can also buy and use it.</p>
