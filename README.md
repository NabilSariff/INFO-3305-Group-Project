**INTRODUCTION**

  Since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the rest of the world, many have been affected by this condition and are going through new norms to survive. Shoeniverse is an app that has options for those who love shoes as their lifestyle. Basically, people will buy it in physical stores but as a result of this pandemic, movement becomes limited. So, with this app they can choose their favorite shoes through online.
  
  Moving in line with today’s world of technology, we got the idea to develop this Shoeniverse app. With this application, they do not have to worry about going out to find shoes in the physical store because through this application, it can curb close contact and break the Covid-19 chain. Not only that, the shoes offered are also unisex type shoes. In this case, men and women can also buy and use it.



**OBJECTIVE**

1. To make it easier for customers to buy shoes through online.
2. To enable customers to take advantage of the discount opportunities offered.
3. To allow customers to have a wide selection of shoes.
4. To offer reasonable prices so it is affordable to almost anyone



**FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITIES**

•	Sign up & login
A long sign-up period is something that no one likes. It's a fiddly job to fill up too many areas. When it comes to app sign-ups, we want to make it as simple as possible for your users to complete.

•	User-Friendly (clean & navigation)
A website should have a neat and tidy appearance, with no unnecessary, sophisticated, or gimmicky features. The navigation system of an online store is perhaps the most important feature. Any website, but particularly e-commerce sites, requires excellent navigation. Users must be able to easily navigate between various categories and items using an intuitive navigation system.

•	Search bar
The best way to locate a piece of knowledge on a large scale site is to use search. A simple search consists of an input box where user can type and hit search. The ability to provide seamless ecommerce experiences that optimise conversions relies heavily on search.

•	Shopping cart 
A shopping cart is one of the most common features in mobile commerce apps. This is a feature that every online store should have, and mobile shopping apps are no exception. It enables consumers to enjoy the freedom they have when making purchases.

•	Promotion and discount
Sales and promotions in mobile shopping apps are just as effective as they are in physical stores. This feature will enhances the user experience and increases sales at your shop.

•	Payment
Today's e-Commerce mobile apps have in-app payments as a regular feature. You streamline the process of completing the transaction and provide a better user experience by providing the consumer with a variety of safe payment methods.
